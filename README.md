# üèôÔ∏è Procedural City Generator

A web-based procedural city generator that creates unique urban landscapes using algorithmic generation. Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Multiple Road Patterns**: Grid, organic, radial, and mixed road layouts
- **Building Styles**: Modern, classical, futuristic, and mixed architectural styles
- **City Sizes**: Small, medium, and large city configurations
- **Real-time Generation**: Generate new cities instantly with different parameters
- **Statistics**: View building count, road count, parks, and estimated population
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

The city generator uses procedural algorithms to create:

1. **Road Networks**: Different patterns create varied urban layouts
2. **Buildings**: Placed strategically to avoid roads with style-specific details
3. **Parks**: Green spaces with randomly placed trees
4. **Population Calculation**: Based on building density and area

## Usage

1. Select your preferred city size (small, medium, large)
2. Choose a building style (modern, classical, futuristic, mixed)
3. Pick a road pattern (grid, organic, radial, mixed)
4. Click "Generate New City" to create a unique urban landscape
5. View the city statistics below the canvas

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering

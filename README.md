## 🚀 How It Works

The advanced city generator uses sophisticated procedural algorithms:

1. **Water Generation**: Creates realistic water bodies with flow effects
2. **Road Networks**: Advanced patterns including fractal and spiral layouts
3. **Building Placement**: Smart collision detection avoiding roads and water
4. **Architectural Details**: Style-specific features like gothic arches, modern glass, Asian pagodas
5. **Landmark Generation**: Special buildings with unique visual effects
6. **Statistics Calculation**: Realistic population and area calculations

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Choose City Settings**: Select size, architecture style, and road pattern
2. **Adjust Advanced Options**: Fine-tune density, parks, and water features
3. **Set Visual Preferences**: Pick time of day and render quality
4. **Generate**: Click "Generate New City" to create unique urban landscapes
5. **Save & Share**: Download or share your favorite cities
